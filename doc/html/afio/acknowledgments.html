<p>
      We would like to thank all the people who contributed to the development of
      this library, many of whom are not listed here but nevertheless are due our
      thanks. Our especial thanks goes:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
          To the family and friends who had to put up with us during Google Summer
          of Code 2013 adding 15-25 hours per week above and beyond our normal work
          hours which meant time not spent with them. This part is without doubt
          the hardest part of developing a new Boost library &#8212; what it requires
          you to sacrifice in exchange for what little free time is already left
          over after a work week.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Google, for sponsoring Paul to work on AFIO as part of Google Summer
          of Code 2013. Paul did the lion's share of the work of porting the preexisting
          pure C++ 11 code base to Boost and to older compilers, both tasks which
          could never be called fun by anyone.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To my former team and division at BlackBerry who successfully obtained
          the first ever corporate permission for an employee to contribute to a
          non-business open source project. The many months of wrangling to achieve
          that win was made moot when I was downsized towards the end of GSoC, nevertheless
          my thanks are due to BlackBerry for trying to change itself and letting
          me be a part of that.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Christopher M. Kohlhoff for providing Boost.ASIO, which has been a high
          benchmark to aspire towards.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Bjorn Reese for taking the time to be an early adopter of AFIO, and
          making many observations of where AFIO could be obviously improved, almost
          all of which were our delight to enact.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Vicente J. Botet Escriba for very kindly adding a method to Boost.Thread's
          future's for directly fetching their exception_ptr. This greatly improved
          AFIO's exception propagation performance.
