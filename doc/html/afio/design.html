      Boost.AFIO came about out of the need for a scalable, high performance, portable
      asynchronous file i/o implementation library for a forthcoming filing system
      based graph store ACID compliant transactional persistence layer called TripleGit
      &#8212; call it a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">SQLite3 but for graphstores</span>&#8221;</span><sup>[<a name="afio.design.f0" href="#ftn.afio.design.f0" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup>. The fact that a portable asynchronous file i/o library for C++
      was needed at all came as a bit of a surprise: one thinks of these things as
      done and dusted decades ago, but it turns out that the fully featured <a href="http://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/filesystem.html" target="_top">libuv</a>, a C library,
      is good enough for most people needing portable asynchronous file i/o. However
      as great as libuv is, it isn't very C++-ish, and hooking it in with <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/asio/" target="_top">Boost.ASIO</a> (parts of which are
      expected to enter the ISO C++ language standard) isn't particularly clean.
      I therefore resolved to write a native Boost asynchronous file i/o implementation,
      and keep it as simple as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      Boost.AFIO is actually, of course, really a different take on Google's <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3731.pdf" target="_top">WG21
      N3731 (Executors and schedulers v2)</a> and Microsoft's <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3721.pdf" target="_top">WG21
      N3721 (Improvements to std::future&lt;T&gt; and Related APIs)</a>. Both
      Google and Microsoft, like many other big iron C++ users, have much need to
      asynchronously execute large numbers of closures (bound function objects) with
      various dependencies between the completion of one or more closures before
      allowing the starting of one or more other closures. What one effectively does
      is to create a <span class="emphasis"><em>dependency chain</em></span> of small items to be executed,
      and then fire as many compute resources as possible at those chains, with the
      engine executing as many of them simultaneously as is permitted by the requirements
      of the dependency chains. Boost.AFIO differs from N3562 by directly extending
      Boost.ASIO, so if you're already using Boost.ASIO to do your networking, well
      it's a real cinch to add in asynchronous closure execution e.g. <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">if a
      packet of data arrives, do this set of operations according to this dependency
      chain</span>&#8221;</span>. Boost.AFIO differs from N3634 by going a lot further than N3634
      does by having explicit support for both Boost.ASIO and targeted file i/o support
      infrastructure. Boost.AFIO therefore lies somewhere in between N3562 and N3634
      in terms of complexity, but instead of specifying a new system of executors
      it uses Boost.ASIO central dispatch engine as the executor.
    </p>
<p>
      For v1.0, AFIO used a simple dispatch engine which kept the extant ops in a
      hash table, and the entire dispatch engine was protected by a single giant
      and recursive mutex. Performance never exceeded about 150k ops/sec maximum
      on a four core Intel Ivy Bridge CPU.
    </p>
<p>
      That performance was embarrassing, so for v1.1 the entire engine was rewritten
      using vast numbers of atomics to be completely lock free, and very nearly wait
      free if it weren't for the thin spin locks around the central ops hash table
      (which are replaced with memory transactions if Intel TSX extensions are available,
      with support for <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">__transaction_relaxed</span></code>
      compilers if <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">BOOST_HAVE_TRANSACTIONAL_MEMORY_COMPILER</span></code>
      is defined). Now performance can reach 1.5m ops/sec on a four core Intel Ivy
      Bridge CPU, or more than half of Boost.ASIO's maximum dispatch rate, which
      probably means AFIO is close to optimal now, at least without having to replace
      the use of STL multithreading facilities and the system memory allocator with
      more exotic varieties.
    </p>
<p>
      For the v1.2 engine, another large refactor was done, this time to substantially
      simplify the engine by removing the use of <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">std</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">packaged_task</span><span class="special">&lt;&gt;</span></code> completely, replacing it with a new
      intrusive-capable <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">enqueued_task</span><span class="special">&lt;&gt;</span></code> which permits the engine to early out
      in many cases, plus allowing the consolidation of all synchronisation points
      to just two: one in dispatch, and one other in completion, which is now optimal.
      Performance of the non-TSX engine rose by about 20% over the v1.1 engine, plus
      AFIO is now fully clean on all race detecting tools.

        The <a href="http://unqlite.org/" target="_top">UnQLite embedded NoSQL database engine</a>
        is exactly one of those of course. Unfortunately I intend TripleGit for implementing
        portable Component Objects for C++ extending C++ Modules, which means I need
        a database engine suitable for incorporation into a dynamic linker, which
        unfortunately is not quite UnQLite.
