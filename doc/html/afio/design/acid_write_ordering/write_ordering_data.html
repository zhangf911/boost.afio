          Implementing performant Durability essentially reduces down to answering
          two questions: (i) how long does it take to restore a consistent state
          after an unexpected power loss, and (ii) how much of your most recent data
          are you willing to lose? AFIO has been designed and written as the asynchronous
          file i/o portability layer for the forthcoming direct filing system graphstore
          database TripleGit which, like as with ZFS, implements late Durability
          i.e. you are guaranteed that your writes from some wall clock distance
          from now can never be lost. As discussing how TripleGit will use AFIO is
          probably useful to many others, that is what the remainder of this section
          does.
        </p>
<p>
          TripleGit will achieve the Consistent and Isolated parts of being a reliable
          database by placing abortable, garbage collectable concurrent writes of
          new data into separate files, and pushing the atomicity enforcement into
          a very small piece of ordering logic in order to reduce transaction contention
          by multiple writers as much as possible. The ordering logic will make use
          of an atomic append only intent log which records what the database intends
          to do (and generally you want that intent log on as low latency a device
          as possible) &#8212; and usefully every major filing system supports atomic
          appends to a file. If you wish to never lose most recent data, to implement
          a transaction one (i) writes one's data to the filing system, (ii) ensure
          it has reached non-volatile storage, (iii) appends the knowledge it definitely
          is on non-volatile storage to the intent log, and then (iv) ensure one's
          append also has reached non-volatile storage. This is presently the only
          way to ensure that valuable data definitely is never lost on any filing
          system that I know of. The obvious problem is that this method involves
          writing all your data with <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">O_SYNC</span></code>
          and using <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsync</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          on the intent log. This might perform okay with a single writer, but with
          multiple writers performance is usually awful, especially on storage incapable
          of high queue depths and potentially many hundreds of milliseconds of latency
          (e.g. SD Cards). Despite the performance issues, there are many valid use
          cases for especially precious data, and TripleGit of course will offer
          such a facility, at both the per-graph and per-update levels.
        </p>
<p>
          TripleGit's normal persistence strategy is a bit more clever: write all
          your data, but keep a hash like a SHA of its contents as you write it<sup>[<a name="afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f0" href="#ftn.afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f0" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup>. When you write your intent log, atomically append all the
          SHAs of the items you just wrote and skip <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">O_DATA</span></code>
          and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsync</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          completely. If power gets removed before all the data is written to non-volatile
          storage, you can figure out that the database is dirty easily enough, and
          you simply parse from the end of the intent log backwards, checking each
          item's contents to ensure their SHAs match up, throwing away any transaction
          where any file is missing or any file's contents don't match. On a filing
          system such as ext4 where data is guaranteed to be sent to non-volatile
          storage after one minute<sup>[<a name="afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f1" href="#ftn.afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f1" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>, and of course so long as you don't mind losing up to one minute's
          worth of data, this solution can have much better performance than the
          previous solution with lots of simultaneous writers.
        </p>
<p>
          The problem though is that while better, performance is still far less
          than optimal. Firstly, you have to calculate a whole load of hashes all
          the time, and that isn't trivial especially on lower end platforms like
          a mobile phone where 25-30 cycles per byte SHA256 performance might be
          typical. Secondly, dirty database reconstruction is rather like how ext2
          had to call <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsck</span></code> on boot:
          a whole load of time and i/o must be expended to fix up damage in the store,
          and while it's running one generally must wait.
        </p>
<p>
          What would be really, really useful is if the filing system exposed its
          internal write ordering constraint implementation to user mode code, so
          one could say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">schedule writing A, B, C and D in any order whenever
          you get round to it, but you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> write all of those
          before you write any of E, F and G</span>&#8221;</span>. Such an ability gives maximum
          scope to the filing system to reorder and coalesce writes as it sees fit,
          but still allows database implementations to ensure that a transaction's
          intent log entry can never appear without all the data it refers to. Such
          an ability would eliminate the need for expensive dirty database checking
          and reconstruction, or the need for any journalling infrastructure used
          to skip the manual integrity checking.
        </p>
<p>
          Unfortunately I know of no filing system which makes publicly available
          such a facility. The closest that I know of is ZFS which internally uses
          a concept of transaction groups which are, for all intents and purposes,
          partial whole filing system snapshots issued once every five seconds. Data
          writes may be reordered into any order within a transaction group, but
          transaction group commits are strongly tied to the wall clock and are
          <span class="bold"><strong>always</strong></span> committed sequentially. Since the
          addition of the ZFS Write Throttle, the default settings are to accept
          new writes as fast as RAM can handle, buffering up to thirty wall clock
          seconds of writes before pacing the acceptance of new write data to match
          the speed of the non-volatile storage (which may be a ZFS Intent Log (ZIL)
          device if you're doing synchronous writes). This implies up to thirty seconds
          of buffered data could be lost, but note that ZFS still guarantees transaction
          group sequential write order. Therefore, what ZFS is in fact guaranteeing
          is this: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">we may reorder your write by up to five seconds away from
          the sequence in which you wrote it and other writes surrounding it. Other
          than that, we guarantee the order in which you write is the order in which
          that data reaches physical storage.</span>&#8221;</span> <sup>[<a name="afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f2" href="#ftn.afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f2" class="footnote">8</a>]</sup>
        </p>
<p>
          What this means is this: on ZFS, TripleGit can turn off all write synchronisation
          and replace it with a five second delay between writing new data and updating
          the intent log, and in so doing guaranteeing that the intent log's contents
          will <span class="bold"><strong>always</strong></span> refer to data definitely on
          storage (or rather, close enough that one need not perform a lot of repair
          work on first use after power loss). One can additionally skip SHA hashing
          because ZFS guarantees file and metadata will always match and as TripleGit
          always copy on writes data, either a copy's length matches the intent log's
          or it doesn't (i.e. the file's length as reported by the filing system
          really is how much true data it contains), plus the file modified timestamp
          always reflects the actual last modifed timestamp of the data.
        </p>
<p>
          Note that ext3 and ext4 can also guarantee that file and metadata will
          always match using the (IOPS expensive) mount option <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">data</span><span class="special">=</span><span class="identifier">journal</span></code>,
          which can be detected from <code class="computeroutput"><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">proc</span><span class="special">/</span><span class="identifier">mounts</span></code>. If combined with the proprietary
          Linux call <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">syncfs</span><span class="special">()</span></code>,
          one can reasonably emulate ZFS's behaviour, albeit rather inefficiently.
        </p>
<p>
          Sadly, most use of TripleGit and Boost.AFIO will be without the luxury
          of ZFS, so here is a quick table of power loss data safety. Once again,
          I reiterate that errors and omissions are my fault alone. <span class="bold"><strong>Any

                      This is where a filing system permits you to deallocate the
                      physical storage of a region of a file, so a file claiming
                      to occupy 8Mb could be reduced to 1Mb of actual storage consumption.
                      This may sound like sparse file support, but transparent compression
                      support also counts as it would reduce a region written with
                      all zeros to nearly zero physical storage

            TripleGit actually uses a different, much faster 256 bit 3 cycles/byte
