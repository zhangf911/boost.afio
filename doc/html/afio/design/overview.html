<p>
        Boost.AFIO version 1 is amongst the smallest standalone libraries in the
        Boost C++ libraries. Its total active lines of code is around 1,000 lines,
        and implementing its documentatation and other associated necessities for
        Boost peer review took longer than writing and debugging the code itself.
        Yet despite its shortness of length, AFIO has some unusual design choices,
        and probably what some might initially think (before they've used it) is
        an unintuitive API.
      </p>
<p>
        Some quick terminology:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
            <a class="link" href="../reference/structs/async_io_op.html" title="async_io_op"><code class="computeroutput"><span class="keyword">struct</span>
            <span class="identifier">async_io_op</span></code></a> is a reference
            to a scheduled operation. I'll call this an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">op reference</span>&#8221;</span>
            or just plain <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">op</span>&#8221;</span> from now on for convenience. There can
            be many op references, but only one unique op. You can distinguish between
            ops using their dispatcher parent pointer and the id field, which is
            always a unique non-zero <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">size_t</span></code>
            value<sup>[<a name="afio.design.overview.f0" href="#ftn.afio.design.overview.f0" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>. An op's id is guaranteed to be unique within its dispatcher
            until its last op reference is destructed, at which point that id becomes
            available for reuse.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            <a class="link" href="../reference/functions/when_all_ops.html" title="when_all() (ops)"><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">when_all</span><span class="special">()</span></code></a> returns a future which will
            become ready when all the ops passed in as input have completed. One
            can therefore wait for a given set of ops to complete using <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">when_all</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="identifier">ops</span><span class="special">).</span><span class="identifier">wait</span><span class="special">()</span></code>.
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            <a class="link" href="../reference/classes/async_file_io_dispatcher_base/barrier.html" title="barrier (batch)"><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">async_file_io_dispatcher_base</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">barrier</span><span class="special">()</span></code></a>
            schedules a synchronisation of its input batch of ops by only completing
            any of its output batch (which is a duplicate of its input) when the
            very last one of its inputs completes. This is effectively an asynchronous
            <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">when_all</span><span class="special">()</span></code>.
          </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        Here were the design imperatives underpinning the AFIO design:
      </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
            Everything, absolutely everything happens asynchronously. If you want
            synchronous, wait for the asynchronous operation to complete (and make
            this easy to program, see above).
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            Everything, absolutely everything is batch. This is one of my big bugbears
            with filing system API design: they do everything in units of a single
            file operation at a time (with the notable exception of the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">readv</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
            and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">writev</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
            scatter/gather file i/o family of POSIX functions). Yet, and especially
            if it's within the same directory, a batch API can be <span class="bold"><strong>very</strong></span>
            significantly faster than a multitude of single APIs.
            <p>
              As much as AFIO is as constrained by the system-level filing system
              API as anyone else, AFIO employs a thread source (which is probably
              a thread pool, but could be anything) as a crude, universally portable
              method of dispatching multiple filing system operations at the same
              time. For those platforms which support a less crude method of delivering
              batches of filing system operations e.g. an actual batch API, that
              is used instead. Additionally, micro-kernel platforms are always able
              to multiplex <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> set of asynchronous syscalls
              using a single thread, so for those platforms no thread pool is needed
              at all.
            </p>
          </li>
<li class="listitem">
            Error reporting <span class="bold"><strong>always</strong></span> follows the
            <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">earliest possible reporting</span>&#8221;</span> rule. As absolutely everything
            is asynchronous in AFIO, that also means that exception handling also
            occurs asynchronously. So how are exceptions delivered to something which
            might make use of them? The rules are as follows:
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a">
<li class="listitem">
                  If you try to use an op reference as an input and that reference
                  is errored at the point of use, the exception contained by that
                  op is immediately rethrown.
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  If you use an op reference that has not yet completed (and therefore
                  its error state is currently unknown) as an input to a <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">when_all</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
                  function, and that input later errors during the wait, if that
                  <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">when_all</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
                  function is not a <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">std</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">nothrow_t</span></code>
                  variant the exception will be rethrown at the point that one waits
                  on the future returned by the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">when_all</span><span class="special">()</span></code>.
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  If you schedule an operation with a precondition which errors,
                  that exception is <span class="bold"><strong>NOT</strong></span> propagated
                  to its dependencies. This is because you usually don't want that
                  to happen e.g. if you run out of disc space during a write, you
                  don't want all further operations to fail. If your dependent operation
                  really needs to know if its preceding operation errored, just go
                  ahead and check for it manually using the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">h</span></code>
                  member which is a shared_ptr to a future &#8212; if that future
                  contains an exception, your precondition has errored<sup>[<a name="afio.design.overview.f1" href="#ftn.afio.design.overview.f1" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup>.
                </li>
<li class="listitem">
                  The only exception to the preceding rule is the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">barrier</span><span class="special">()</span></code> call which <span class="bold"><strong>DOES</strong></span>
                  propagate errored state to its output. Something which catches
                  a lot of people is that the first rule also applies to <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">barrier</span><span class="special">()</span></code>,
                  so if an input op is errored on entry to <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">barrier</span><span class="special">()</span></code>, it rethrows there and then,
                  but if that input op errored a microsecond after the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">barrier</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
                  started, then it does not rethrow but instead propagates the errored
                  state into its output.
                </li>

<li class="listitem">
            Keep things very, very simple for this first version of AFIO. That means
            no direct ACL nor permissions support, no direct ability to cancel scheduled
            operations, no direct ability to delay scheduling (e.g. on the basis
            of a timer) etc. What you get is the bare essentials, but it is very
            straightforward to wrap up functionality from <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem/" target="_top">Boost.Filesystem</a>
            or <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/iostreams/" target="_top">Boost.Iostreams</a>
            as an asynchronous closure operation using <a class="link" href="../reference/classes/async_file_io_dispatcher_base/call_2_batch_bound_functions.html" title="call (batch bound functions)"><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">async_file_io_dispatcher_base</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">call</span><span class="special">()</span></code></a>,
            and timers are provided already by <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/asio/" target="_top">Boost.ASIO</a>
            which can be wrapped as preconditions for other operations.
            <p>
              It also means that we use the native standard C++ library multithreading
              facilities (with the exception of futures and promises where we always
              currently use Boost's implementations due to their much superior feature
              set). These are not as fast as custom written support could be, but
              they do have the big advantage of enabling easy interoperation with
              other C++ code. Besides, as libraries such as Boost.AFIO start to tax
              standard C++ library multithreading implementations in novel ways,
              I am sure that the performance penalty will decrease over time as STL
              vendors do their tuning.

<li class="listitem">
            Assume a certain amount of long-implemented C++11 features which have
            been around for at least three years in all major compilers, like the
            <code class="computeroutput"><span class="keyword">auto</span></code> keyword, move construction
            (i.e. rvalue references) and lambdas (which are obviously useful for
            convenient closure writing). This is important, because while AFIO won't
            compile with C++03 compilers and probably never will (which some will
            feel is a big problem), we can make use of returning fairly oblique and
            lengthy to type return types which won't bother the programmer because
            they'll be using <code class="computeroutput"><span class="keyword">auto</span></code> for
            return types. Similarly, we pass around plenty of <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">std</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">vector</span><span class="special">&lt;</span><span class="identifier">async_io_op</span><span class="special">&gt;</span></code> by <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> as
            a convenient lightweight batch op container which would ordinarily be
            suicidal for performance under C++03, but under C++11 the compiler simply
            move constructs the contents by swapping as little as sixteen bytes
            <sup>[<a name="afio.design.overview.f2" href="#ftn.afio.design.overview.f2" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup>. On top of that, passing around by value lets the compiler
            easily perform alias optimisations with no need for a <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">restrict</span></code>
            keyword, so in general AFIO passes things around by value wherever possible
            and lets the compiler figure out the optimal course of action.

            Lastly, even though no filing system known to this author currently supports
            such a feature, Boost.AFIO implements <span class="emphasis"><em>write ordering constraints</em></span>
            at the whole file level as well as the traditionally supported individual
            write level. This part will need some explaining, so it gets a whole

              wraps. The code handles this correctly by the way, always ensuring
              every newly allocated integer id is always non-zero and always not
              yet in the hash table of currently known operations.

                    handler is being invoked from an operation which has errored.

              Note that on older compilers with earlier versions of C++11 support,
              automatic use of move construction where a copy constructor is also
              available isn't implemented. We try to use <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">std</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">move</span><span class="special">()</span></code> where we can to help the compiler,
              but in truth there is no substitute for a modern C++11 implementation.
