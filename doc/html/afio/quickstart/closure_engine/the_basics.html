          First, it will be useful to introduce some core ideas before moving on
          to a more indepth look at closure execution engines. Let us begin with
          a simple definition of a closure. Wikipedia.org supplies a clear definition:
        </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
            &#8220;In programming languages, a closure (also lexical closure or function
            closure) is a function or reference to a function together with a referencing
            environment&#8212;a table storing a reference to each of the non-local variables
            (also called free variables or upvalues) of that function.[1] A closure&#8212;unlike
            a plain function pointer&#8212;allows a function to access those non-local
            variables even when invoked outside of its immediate lexical scope.&#8221;
          </p></blockquote></div>
<p>
          <sup>[<a name="afio.quickstart.closure_engine.the_basics.f0" href="#ftn.afio.quickstart.closure_engine.the_basics.f0" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup>
        </p>
<p>
          Basically, a closure can be thought of as an anonymous function object
          capable of capturing local state for use outside of its lexical scope.
          In C++ a closure strongly implies the use of a lambda expression, though
          there are other ways to create closures. C++ is a very powerful and flexible
          language, and how a closure is created is of less importance than what
          it does. If you are unfamiliar with lambdas or closures in C++ we encourage
          you to do some research on the subjects before continuing, as a basic understanding
          of these core concepts will be important moving forward.
        </p>
<p>
          Now that we have a basic idea of what a closure is, consider the role that
          a closure execution engine plays: to execute the closures supplied to it.
          How the engine works is largely driven by its design goals and performance
          criteria. A simplistic analogy is to consider a rocket engine and a combustion
          engine found in an automobile: both engines fill similar roles (vehicle
          propulsion) but are quite different in how they work and perform the basic
          task of vehicle locomotion, ie their design goals and performance criteria
          are completely different. A closure execution engine is a fairly general
          term, and implies little about the underlying implementation.
        </p>
<p>
          Earlier, we defined Boost.AFIO as a specialized type of closure execution
          engine: an asynchronous, chainable, batch executable, closure execution
          engine. Now that we have a basic understanding of what a closure execution
          engine is, understanding that it is asynchronous, chainable and batch executable
          aren't quite as daunting.
        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
              Asynchonous: closures can be completed in an asynchronous fashion,
              rather than with traditional sequential blocking behavior. Note that
              asynchronous does not necessarily imply concurrency.
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              Chainable: closures can be chained together, so that dependent operations
              can be scheduled for execution after the closures they depend on have
              been completed.
            </li>
<li class="listitem">
              Batch Executable: A group of closures can be scheduled for execution.
            </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
          So, Boost.AFIO can execute batches of sequential closures for asynchronous
          completion. What this means for users is that it is possible to break up
          a series of sequential tasks into a closures, and have Boost.AFIO schedule
          them for asynchronous completion while the main thread is free to complete
          other work.
        </p>
<p>
          Boost.AFIO is primarily implemented as a threadpool that executes the closures
          fed to it based on some internal logic. In essence Boost.AFIO creates a
          thread whose responsibility it is to schedule closures for execution within
          a threadpool. This allows user code to schedule some operations for future
          completion, and even to schedule a series of operations to be executed
          one after another, while leaving the main application free to complete
          other work while waiting for closures to execute. This ability to chain
          closures together makes it possible to schedule work to begin as soon as
          it is able, and avoids waiting for an entire set of operations to complete
          before any other tasks can begin.
