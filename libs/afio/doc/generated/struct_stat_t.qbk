Metadata about a directory entry. 

[heading Description]
This structure looks somewhat like a `struct stat`, and indeed it was derived from BSD's `struct stat`. However there are a number of changes to better interoperate with modern practice, specifically: (i) inode value containers are forced to 64 bits. (ii) Timestamps use C++11's `std::chrono::system\u005fclock::time\u005fpoint` or Boost equivalent. The resolution of these may or may not equal what a `struct timespec` can do depending on your STL. (iii) The type of a file, which is available on Windows and on POSIX without needing an additional syscall, is provided by `st\u005ftype` which is one of the values from `std::filesystem::file\u005ftype`. (iv) As type is now separate from permissions, there is no longer a `st\u005fmode`, instead being a `st\u005fperms` which is solely the permissions bits. If you want to test permission bits in `st\u005fperms` but don't want to include platform specific headers, note that `std::filesystem::perms` contains definitions of the POSIX permissions flags.
